        <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
        <p>
	    WebAssembly is an emerging standard for sandboxing and running
	    platform independent code. While seeing rapid adoption
	    on the web, it's also finding many applications beyond
	    the browser, from serverless platforms to IoT.  This mini
	    workshop provides a forum for discussing applications of Wasm
	    beyond the browser, challenges to using Wasm in these domains,
	    and potential language extensions to overcome these challenges.

        </p>
	<h2>Intended Audience</h2>
        <p>
	  Our workshop brings together researchers, core WebAssembly
	  developers, and developers exploring the implications of using WebAssembly 
	  beyond the browser.  Our goal is to facilitate the exchange of ideas
	  and seed future collaborations between these communities.
	</p>
	<h2> Format </h2>
        <p>
	  The workshop will consist of a few short talks, breakout sessions,
	  and a dinner.  For those who can't attend in person, remote
	  participation will supported through video conferencing.

        </p>
                <h2>Topics of interest (including, but not limited to)</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Applications of Wasm outside the browser such as IoT, serverless, big data, library sandboxing, blockchain, etc.</li>
        <li>Wasm runtime and libraries support for non-browser application domains</li>
        <li>Interfacing Wasm with non-browser environments</li>
        <li>Wasm language extensions for security, performance, etc.</li>
        <li>Support for non-C-like languages in Wasm</li>
        </ul>
