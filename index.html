        <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
        <p>
            WebAssembly is an emerging standard for sandboxing and running
            platform independent code that has seen rapid adoption. The goal of
            this mini workshop is to provide a forum for discussing different
            application domains that can reap the benefits of Wasmâ€™s
            portability, the challenges with using Wasm in these domains, and
            potential extensions to the language.
        </p>
        <p>
          The format of the workshop will consist of a few short talks, breakout
          sessions, and a dinner.  The main purpose of this workshop is to
          exchange ideas and seed collaborations around WebAssembly.  We will use
          video conferencing software to allow for remote participation.
        </p>
        <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
        <p>
          WebAssembly beyond the Browser seeks to bring together researchers,
          core WebAssembly developers, and developers exploring the
          implications of using WebAssembly in the browser and beyond.
        </p>
        <h2>Topics of interest (including, but not limited to)</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Wasm runtime systems and libraries</li>
        <li>Applications of Wasm outside the browser (e.g., IoT, serverless, blockchain, etc.)</li>
        <li>Wasm language extensions for security, performance, etc.</li>
        <li>Support for non-C-like language</li>
        <li>Host/Wasm interfaces and marshaling</li>
        </ul>
